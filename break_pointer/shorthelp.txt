<html><body><h2>Algorithm description</h2>
    <p>The Break Point Index (BPI) tool is designed for landscape ecological analysis of patch shape and boundary configuration. It processes polygonal landscape patches by evaluating vertex angles along patch boundaries within user-defined angular thresholds, identifying breakpoints that reflect directional changes and geometric irregularities of landscape elements. The tool generates point features representing boundary complexity and computes polygon-level BPI values together with density metrics normalized by perimeter and area. Options to include or exclude inner rings (holes) and to customize angular thresholds allow flexible assessment of landscape pattern, configuration, and shape complexity.</p>
    <h2>Input parameters</h2>
    <h3>Input layer</h3>
